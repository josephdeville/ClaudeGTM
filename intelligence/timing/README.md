# Timing Intelligence

> **When do companies buy? What signals indicate readiness? What triggers urgency?**

## Purpose

**Bad GTM:** Spray and pray, hope something sticks

**Good GTM:** Target companies showing buying signals

**Great GTM:** Know *exactly* what triggers indicate a company is ready to buy, and why

This directory captures **timing intelligence**—patterns about when companies actually convert, what signals predict buying behavior, and what creates urgency.

## Core Principle

You're not selling lead generation. You're selling GTM infrastructure.

**Key Question:** "What events cause a company to say 'we need better GTM systems NOW'?"

## Timing Intelligence Categories

### 1. Funding Events

**Hypothesis:** Companies that just raised money invest in GTM infrastructure

**Intelligence to Capture:**
- How long after funding do they buy? (30 days? 90 days?)
- Which funding stages care? (Seed? Series A? Series B?)
- What's the trigger narrative? ("We just raised $XM to scale sales...")
- Which roles get hired post-funding? (VP Sales = buying signal?)
- Hit rate by funding stage?

**Pattern Format:**
```
Trigger: Series A Funding Announcement
Buying Window: 30-90 days post-announcement
Decision Maker: VP Sales (usually hired in first 60 days)
Trigger Narrative: "We need to scale from 10→100 accounts/month"
Hit Rate: [X]% convert to qualified opp
Time to Close: [Y] days average
Evidence: [Z] engagements tracked
```

### 2. Hiring Signals

**Hypothesis:** Hiring specific roles indicates GTM investment

**Key Roles:**
- VP Sales / CRO (they need infrastructure fast)
- Sales Ops / Rev Ops (they're building systems)
- SDR team expansion (need automation to scale)
- GTM leadership from larger companies (bring enterprise expectations)

**Intelligence to Capture:**
- Which roles are highest-signal?
- How long after posting do they buy?
- What's their first 90-day playbook? (Can you insert yourself?)
- Where do they hire from? (Enterprise background = compliance needs?)

### 3. Technology Adoption

**Hypothesis:** Companies adopting certain tools need GTM infrastructure

**High-Signal Tool Adoptions:**
- Moving from HubSpot Free → Professional (ready to invest)
- Implementing Salesforce (enterprise systems need)
- Adding Outreach/Salesloft (scaling outbound)
- Deploying ABM platforms (sophisticated GTM motion)

**Intelligence to Capture:**
- Which tool changes predict buying behavior?
- What's the implementation timeline? (When do they need help?)
- What gaps do these tools create? (Clay fills what holes?)

### 4. Product/Market Signals

**Hypothesis:** Product milestones trigger GTM investment

**Potential Triggers:**
- Product launch (need to fill pipeline)
- New market expansion (need ICP research)
- Upmarket move (enterprise systems required)
- Geographic expansion (new data sources needed)

### 5. Performance Gaps

**Hypothesis:** Missed targets create urgent buying behavior

**Signals:**
- Layoffs in sales team (restructuring = new systems)
- Leadership changes (new VP = new stack)
- Public struggles (negative reviews, churn rumors)
- Competitive pressure (losing deals to better-automated competitors)

**Intelligence to Capture:**
- Which pain points create urgency?
- What's the trigger conversation?
- How fast can you close when pain is acute?

### 6. Seasonal Patterns

**Hypothesis:** GTM investments follow predictable cycles

**Patterns to Track:**
- Q4 budget planning (lock in next year)
- Q1 implementation (new fiscal year)
- Mid-year adjustments (missed targets → investment)
- Summer slowdowns (avoid?)

## Timing Pattern Format

```markdown
# [Trigger Event]

## Signal Description

**What to monitor:**
[Specific, observable event]

**Where to find it:**
[Data sources, monitoring approaches]

## Buying Behavior

**Window of Opportunity:**
[When after trigger are they most likely to buy?]

**Decision Maker:**
[Who drives purchase at this stage?]

**Trigger Narrative:**
[What problem are they trying to solve?]

**Urgency Level:**
- 🔥 High urgency (will buy in 30 days)
- ⚡ Medium urgency (exploring, 60-90 day cycle)
- 💤 Low urgency (might buy eventually)

## Conversion Data

**Tracked Opportunities:**
[How many times you've seen this pattern]

**Conversion Rate:**
[What % of these signals → qualified opp → closed deal]

**Time to Close:**
[Average sales cycle from signal to close]

**Deal Size:**
[Typical engagement value]

## Approach Playbook

**Outreach Timing:**
[When to reach out relative to trigger]

**Messaging:**
[What resonates with this trigger?]

**Stakeholders:**
[Who to involve at this stage?]

**Objections:**
[Common pushback and handling]

## Evidence Log

- [Date]: [Client/Industry] - [Trigger] → [Outcome]
- [Date]: [Client/Industry] - [Trigger] → [Outcome]
- ...

## Counter-Evidence

**When this signal DIDN'T predict buying:**
[Document false positives]

**Why:**
[What was different?]

## Version History

- [Date]: Initial pattern observed
- [Date]: Updated conversion data
- [Date]: Refined based on [X] new engagements
```

## Building the Timing Playbook

### Phase 1: Hypothesis
Document what you *think* might be buying signals

### Phase 2: Tracking
Monitor these signals in your outreach
Tag opportunities by trigger type

### Phase 3: Validation
After 10-20 engagements, calculate:
- Conversion rate by trigger
- Time to close by trigger
- Deal size by trigger

### Phase 4: Optimization
Double down on high-signal triggers
Ignore low-signal noise

## Timing Intelligence in Practice

**Bad Outreach:**
"Hi, we help companies with data enrichment..."

**Good Outreach:**
"Hi [Name], saw you just joined as VP Sales after your Series A..."

**Great Outreach:**
"Hi [Name], saw you just joined as VP Sales. Based on [Company]'s $XM Series A and 6 SDR openings, you're probably scaling from 10→100 accounts/month. Most teams hit Clay at this exact inflection point because [specific reason]. Want to see how [similar company] solved this?"

**The difference:** Timing intelligence makes outreach *contextually relevant* instead of generic.

## Data Sources for Timing Signals

**Funding:**
- Crunchbase
- LinkedIn announcements
- Company news pages
- VC portfolio pages

**Hiring:**
- LinkedIn job postings
- "We're hiring!" posts
- New employee announcements
- Job boards (Wellfound, etc.)

**Technology:**
- BuiltWith / Wappalyzer (tool changes)
- G2 / Capterra reviews (shopping behavior)
- LinkedIn tech stack posts

**Product/Market:**
- Product Hunt launches
- Company blog announcements
- Press releases
- Conference speaking (market credibility)

## Automation Opportunities

**Clay Tables for Timing:**
- Monitor funding announcements → enrich → score urgency
- Track VP Sales hires → identify → personalized outreach
- Watch job postings → SDR hiring = signal → trigger sequence

**Intelligence Feedback Loop:**
- Tag each opp with trigger source
- Track conversion by trigger
- Update timing intelligence quarterly

## Contributing

After every closed deal:

1. **What was the trigger?** (What made them buy now?)
2. **How long from trigger to close?** (Timeline)
3. **What signals did you miss?** (Earlier indicators you should watch)
4. **What signals were false positives?** (Things that didn't matter)

After every lost deal:

1. **What was the anti-trigger?** (Why not now?)
2. **Was timing wrong?** (Too early? Too late?)
3. **What would make them ready?** (Future trigger to monitor)

**Timing is everything. Know when they're ready to buy.**
